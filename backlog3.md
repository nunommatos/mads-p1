## 1. "Where autopilot was invented"

Lazyness is an inventive quality of the human race. Controlling robots is fun, but after a while it becomes boring. What would be great is if the robots could *explore* the mine automatically, and return a *possible* solution (i.e., a list of commands such as `LLLRUULLLRDD`) that collects all diamonds and returns to the open lift (`O`).

## 2. "Really Slippery Rocks"

New surveys have discovered that rocks also tend to be slippery when standing on the top of Diamonds (`x`). The same previous rules apply:

    #   #      #   #
    # * #      #   #
    # x #  =>  # x*#

    #* *#      #   #
    #* *#  =>  #***#
